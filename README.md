# Bus Mall project

# Why this project?
A few reasons:

Learn more about planning and defining a problem domain
Learn more about DOM, object literals and constructor functions
Better understand how to DOM with JavaScript
Help me practice JavaScript, HTML and CSS coding
It combines the three initial languages I'm learning as a developer: CSS, HTML, JavaScript

# Use:
This is a practice project for me. This likely only has use if you are a student of HTML, CSS and Javascript and want to see examples of different code.
